# Travel Landing Page
This is a **practice project** where I built a clean and responsive **Travel Landing Page** using only **HTML and CSS**. The page is designed to promote a travel agency or destination with a modern and user-friendly layout.

### Features
- Fully responsive design  
- Smooth and clean layout  
- Hero section with CTA (Call to Action)  
- Sections for destinations, services, and contact info  
- Pure HTML and CSS (no JavaScript or frameworks used)

### Project Goals
- Strengthen my skills in **HTML & CSS layout design**  
- Practice building visually appealing static websites  
- Understand responsive design using media queries and flexbox/grid
